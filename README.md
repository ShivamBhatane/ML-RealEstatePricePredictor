# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Real Estate Price Prediction Model** built using **Machine Learning Algorithms**. It aims to predict property prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, crime rate, and other crucial factors. The model is trained on the **UCI Boston Housing Dataset**, a well-known dataset for real estate price prediction tasks.
